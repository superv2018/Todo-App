The live app can be tested via this link: https://victor-todoapp.netlify.com/. This Todo app is created using React. It uses fetch API to send a request to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos which serves as the backend. 

You can add todo items, delete and mark as completed. Any todo items added will be saved and will be deleted after the page reloads as it is not saved in the backend.
