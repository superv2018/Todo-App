The live app can be tested via this link: https://victor-todoapp.netlify.com/. This Todo app is created using React. It uses fetch API to send a request to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos which serves as the backend. Any todo items saved will be deleted after reloading as it is not been saved in the backend.
